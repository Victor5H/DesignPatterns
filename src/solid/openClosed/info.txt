Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

any class or interface should closed for modification, but open for extension

this operation interface allows other developers to use this interface for other operations and
doesnt need to modify any existing classes.

this is how anything should be designed that in later part of project
the functionality should be easily modified without modifying code
