The Adapter Design Pattern, which is a structural pattern, is used to bridge the gap between two
incompatible interfacesâ€”allowing them to work together without changing their existing code.

2. Working with External Libraries (like GCS or AWS SDKs)
Scenario:
You have your own FileUploader interface, but need to use Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3 SDK.

Adapter:
Create an adapter class that implements your interface and internally uses the cloud SDK methods.

3. UI Toolkits Integration
Scenario:
Your app uses JavaFX, but you want to use a custom widget that only supports Swing.

Adapter:
You wrap the Swing widget in an adapter that lets JavaFX treat it like a native component.

4. Database Drivers (JDBC Example)
The JDBC API provides a consistent interface for interacting with different databases. Each database (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) provides a driver (adapter) that conforms to this interface, internally translating JDBC calls to database-specific protocols.

5. Microservices with Different Protocols
Scenario:
One service communicates over REST, another expects gRPC.

Adapter:
You create a bridge or proxy that converts REST requests into gRPC calls.
